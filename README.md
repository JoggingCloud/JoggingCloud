# 👋 Hi, I'm Jabari

I'm an AI Programmer with a strong focus on real-time mutli-threaded navigation, and game AI systems. My work spans from custom pathfinding systems such as A* to velocity-based avoidance algorithms, and probabilistic modeling, and I've built everything in a fully custom C++ engine. 

* 🎓 Master's in Game Development (AI Specialization)
* 🧠 Passionate about AI, optimization, and system design
* 💬 I love talking about AI pathfinding, and AI systems
